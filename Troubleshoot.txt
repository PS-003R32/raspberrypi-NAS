# Can't Access files.
- If you cant access files from another device on the network, then format the storage connected to
  the raspberry pi to 'ext4' using the command: sudo mkfs.ext4 <path to the storage> (format it after unmounting, sudo umount <storage path>)

# Mounting issues
(Check the path of the storage device using: sudo lsblk)
- Unmount the storage if it gets auto mounted using 'sudo umount /<path to the storage>
- Create a directory name it 'storage' in the /mnt directory. Then mount using 'sudo' mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/storage

# SMB issues.
- If you can't set password for the smb user then check if the user is added to the machine (raspberrypi) 
  using: id <username>. (you should first create a new user (sudo adduser --allow-bad-names username) or check if the user is added (id <username>.
  Then add it in the smb.conf as valid user and also set the passord.
- If the storage still not available the check for the user permissions set on the /mnt/storage directory.
  Change the permissions to 777 using: sudo chown -R 777 username:username /mnt/storage
- Once done restart the smbd and nmbd services: sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd
